App: Free food
description: see IOS Readme
Major Function: We implemented a login system that allows user to store and delete their favorite events using session login
                IOS team didn'e have time to integrate that in their client. We also provided the functionality to store the events
                that contains free food at our database. We get rejected when requesting facebook access token so we are unable to 
                fetch facebook data. Currently the events are inputed by a regex file. However, the code for requesting facebook event 
                will still be in the resipotory, facebook_bot.py (Credit: tudoanh https://github.com/tudoanh/python-facebook-bot)
                and events_dao.py.
